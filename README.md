# üöÄ Quick Start Guide

We recommend using our docker setup which comes with Jupyter runtime along with pre-built [actions](https://docs.unskript.com/unskript-product-documentation/actions/what-is-an-action) and [runbooks](https://docs.unskript.com/unskript-product-documentation/readme/what-is-a-runbook). Build your own actions and runbooks with ease!

## Get Started

1. Launch Docker
```
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 --user root unskript/awesome-runbooks:latest
```
2. Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8888/awesome.



## Advanced Usage

In this section, we'll explore advanced configurations that enable:

1. Custom Action and Runbook creation
2. Custom Action creation using OpenAI integration

### Custom Action and Runbook Creation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation
cd Awesome-CloudOps-Automation
```

2. Launch Docker 
  - Use this command to create custom runbooks and actions. (update the first -v line if you used a different directory in step 1).

```bash
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 \
 -v $HOME/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/custom:/unskript/data \
 -v $HOME/.unskript:/unskript/credentials \
 -e ACA_AWESOME_MODE=1 \
 --user root \
 docker.io/unskript/awesome-runbooks:latest
```

3. Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8888/awesome.

### Custom Action Creation using OpenAI Integration

1. Clone this repository to your local machine if you haven't already.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation
cd Awesome-CloudOps-Automation
```

2. Launch Docker with OpenAI parameters:

  - Use this command to create custom GenAI actions (update the first -v line if you used a different directory in step 1).

```bash
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 \
 -v $HOME/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/actions:/unskript/data/actions \
 -v $HOME/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/runbooks:/unskript/data/runbooks \
 -v $HOME/.unskript:/unskript/credentials \
 -e ACA_AWESOME_MODE=1 \
 -e OPENAI_ORGANIZATION_ID=<your openAI org> \
 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=<your API key> \
 -e OPENAI_MODEL=GPT-4 \
 --user root \
 docker.io/unskript/awesome-runbooks:latest

```

The OPENAI parameters are used to initialize Generative AI creation with ChatGPT. They can be omitted from the command, but the generativeAI features will not be available.  For a list of models, visit [openAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview).

3. Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8888/awesome.


You can find more information around how to use and play with our runbooks in the documentation here. You can find a list of all the runbooks along with links in the [repository page](/xrunbooks-directory.md) or simply use [unSkript CLI](unskript-ctl/README.md).
