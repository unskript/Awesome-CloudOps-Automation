# unSkript Open source docker Helm Chart
A Helm Chart for installing and upgrading [unSkript open source docker](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation#open-source-docker)

# Prerequisites
The installation of this Chart does not have prerequisites.

# Limitations
The current chart does not have support for [persistent volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/). Any credential/runbook created would be lost once the pod dies.


# Note
We recommend using 1vCPU and 400Mb of RAM to get the best performance
