## unSkript Runbook

unSkript Runbooks is a collection of atomic Routines called unSkript Actions. Think of it like a building blocks (like Legos) with which you can construct any model you wish. These Actions are nothing but modular Python functions that accomplish a well defined task. Using these Actions you can construct a unSkript Runbook to accomplish a given task.  In that sense unSkript Runbooks is a collection of such Actions and/or Information Text that accomplish a pre-defined task.

## Actions

Actions (sometimes referred to here as Legos) are the Atomic part of a unSkript Runbook. Here is a sample Action that performs a well defined task. 

```
def aws_get_instance_details(handle, instance_id: str, region: str) -> Dict:
    """aws_get_instance_details Returns instance details.

        :type handle: object
        :param handle: Object returned by the task.validate(...) method.

        :type instance_ids: list
        :param instance_ids: List of instance ids.

        :type region: string
        :param region: Region for instance.

        :rtype: Dict with the instance details.
    """

    ec2client = handle.client('ec2', region_name=region)
    instances = []
    response = ec2client.describe_instances(
        Filters=[{"Name": "instance-id", "Values": [instance_id]}])
    for reservation in response["Reservations"]:
        for instance in reservation["Instances"]:
            instances.append(instance)

    return instances[0]
```

This Action expects three parameters as inputs. 
  1. `handle` is an Object of type `Connector AWS`. 
  2. `instance-id`  is the `aws ec2` instance identifier.
  3. `region` is the `aws region` where the `aws ec2` can be found


Actions depend on the respective connector. What this means is that we need to 
create a AWS connector before using this AWS Action. You can create any supported
connector by clicking on `Credentials` -> Add New Credential.
