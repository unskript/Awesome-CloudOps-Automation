# Runbooks in CATEGORY_TYPE_DEVOPS
*AWS [Delete Unattached AWS EBS Volumes](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Delete_Unattached_EBS_Volume.ipynb): This runbook can be used to delete all unattached EBS Volumes within an AWS region. You can delete an Amazon EBS volume that you no longer need. After deletion, its data is gone and the volume can't be attached to any instance. So before deletion, you can store a snapshot of the volume, which you can use to re-create the volume later.
*AWS [Detach EC2 Instance from ASG](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Detach_Instance_from_ASG.ipynb): This runbook can be used to detatch an instance from Auto Scaling Group. You can remove (detach) an instance that is in the Service state from an Auto Scaling group. After the instance is detached, you can manage it independently from the rest of the Auto Scaling group. By detaching an instance, you can move an instance out of one Auto Scaling group and attach it to a different group. For more information, see Attach EC2 instances to your Auto Scaling group.
*AWS [Detach EC2 Instance from ASG and Load balancer](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Detach_ec2_Instance_from_ASG.ipynb): This runbook can be used to detatch an instance from Auto Scaling Group and Load Balancer. You can remove (detach) an instance that is in the InService state from an Auto Scaling group. After the instance is detached, you can manage it independently from the rest of the Auto Scaling group. By detaching an instance, you can move an instance out of one Auto Scaling group and attach it to a different group. For more information, see Attach EC2 instances to your Auto Scaling group.
*AWS [Detect ECS failed deployment](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Detect_ECS_failed_deployment.ipynb): This runbook check if there is a failed deployment in progress for a service in an ECS cluster.

Web encryption protocols like SSL and TLS have been around for nearly three decades. By securing web data in transit, these security measures ensure that third parties can’t simply intercept unencrypted data and cause harm. HTTPS uses the underlying SSL/TLS technology and is the standard way to communicate web data in an encrypted and authenticated manner instead of using insecure HTTP protocol. In this runbook, we implement the industry best practice of redirecting all unencrypted HTTP data to the secure HTTPS protocol.
