* AWS [Add Lifecycle Policy to S3 Buckets](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/AWS_Add_Lifecycle_Policy_To_S3_Buckets.ipynb): Attaching lifecycle policies to AWS S3 buckets enables us to automate the management of object lifecycle in your storage buckets. By configuring lifecycle policies, you can define rules that determine the actions to be taken on objects based on their age or other criteria. This includes transitioning objects to different storage classes, such as moving infrequently accessed data to lower-cost storage tiers or archiving them to Glacier, as well as setting expiration dates for objects. By attaching lifecycle policies to your S3 buckets, you can optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on its lifecycle. Additionally, it allows you to efficiently manage data retention and comply with regulatory requirements or business policies regarding data expiration. This runbook helps us find all the buckets without any lifecycle policy and attach one to them.
* AWS [Change AWS EBS Volume To GP3 Type](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/AWS_Change_EBS_Volume_To_GP3_Type.ipynb): This runbook can be used to change the type of an EBS volume to GP3(General Purpose 3).

* AWS [Change AWS Route53 TTL](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/AWS_Change_Route53_TTL.ipynb): For a record in a hosted zone, lower TTL means that more queries arrive at the name servers because the cached values expire sooner. If you configure a higher TTL for your records, then the intermediate resolvers cache the records for longer time. As a result, there are fewer queries received by the name servers. This configuration reduces the charges corresponding to the DNS queries answered. However, higher TTL slows the propagation of record changes because the previous values are cached for longer periods. This Runbook can be used to configure a higher value of a TTL .
* AWS [Create IAM User with policy](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/AWS_Create_New_IAM_User_With_Policy.ipynb): Create new IAM user with a security Policy.  Sends confirmation to Slack.
* AWS [Delete EBS Volume Attached to Stopped Instances](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/AWS_Delete_EBS_Volumes_Attached_To_Stopped_Instances.ipynb): EBS (Elastic Block Storage) volumes are attached to EC2 Instances as storage devices. Unused (Unattached) EBS Volumes can keep accruing costs even when their associated EC2 instances are no longer running. These volumes need to be deleted if the instances they are attached to are no more required. This runbook helps us find such volumes and delete them.

This metric is reported as a percentage value between 0 and 100.
* AWS [Delete ECS Clusters with Low CPU Utilization](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/AWS_Delete_ECS_Clusters_with_Low_CPU_Utilization.ipynb): ECS clusters are a managed service that allows users to run Docker containers on AWS, making it easier to manage and scale containerized applications. However, running ECS clusters with low CPU utilization can result in wasted resources and unnecessary costs. AWS charges for the resources allocated to a cluster, regardless of whether they are fully utilized or not. By deleting clusters that are not being fully utilized, you can reduce the number of resources being allocated and lower the overall cost of running ECS. Furthermore, deleting unused or low-utilization clusters can also improve overall system performance by freeing up resources for other applications that require more processing power. This runbook helps us to identify such clusters and delete them.
* AWS [Delete AWS ELBs With No Targets Or Instances](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/AWS_Delete_ELBs_With_No_Targets_Or_Instances.ipynb): ELBs are used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets or instances, but if those targets or instances are no longer in use, then the ELBs may be unnecessary and can be deleted to save costs. Deleting ELBs with no targets or instances is a simple but effective way to optimize costs in your AWS environment. By identifying and removing these unused ELBs, you can reduce the number of resources you are paying for and avoid unnecessary charges. This runbook helps you identify all types of ELB's- Network, Application, Classic that don't have any target groups or instances attached to them.

These health checks validate that the endpoint IP addresses are operating as intended. There may be multiple reasons that healtchecks are lying usused for example- health check was mistakenly configured against your application by another customer, health check was configured from your account for testing purposes but wasn't deleted when testing was complete, health check was based on domain names and hence requests were sent due to DNS caching,  Elastic Load Balancing service updated its public IP addresses due to scaling, and the IP addresses were reassigned to your load balancer, and many more. This runbook finds such healthchecks and deletes them to save AWS costs.
