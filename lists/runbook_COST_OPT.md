* AWS [Change AWS EBS Volume To GP3 Type](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Change_AWS_EBS_Volume_To_GP3_Type.ipynb): This runbook can be used to change the type of an EBS volume to GP3(General Purpose 3). GP3 type volume has a number of advantages over it's predecessors. gp3 volumes are ideal for a wide variety of applications that require high performance at low cost
* AWS [Change AWS Route53 TTL](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Change_AWS_Route53_TTL.ipynb): For a record in a hosted zone, lower TTL means that more queries arrive at the name servers because the cached values expire sooner. If you configure a higher TTL for your records, then the intermediate resolvers cache the records for longer time. As a result, there are fewer queries received by the name servers. This configuration reduces the charges corresponding to the DNS queries answered. However, higher TTL slows the propagation of record changes because the previous values are cached for longer periods. This Runbook can be used to configure a higher value of a TTL .
* AWS [Delete EBS Volume Attached to Stopped Instances](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Delete_EBS_Volumes_Attached_To_Stopped_Instances.ipynb): EBS (Elastic Block Storage) volumes are attached to EC2 Instances as storage devices. Unused (Unattached) EBS Volumes can keep accruing costs even when their associated EC2 instances are no longer running. These volumes need to be deleted if the instances they are attached to are no more required. This runbook helps us find such volumes and delete them.
* AWS [Delete EBS Volume With Low Usage](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Delete_EBS_Volumes_With_Low_Usage.ipynb): This runbook can help us identify low usage Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes and delete these volumes in order to lower the cost of your AWS bill. This is calculates using the VolumeUsage metric. It measures the percentage of the total storage space that is currently being used by an EBS volume. This metric is reported as a percentage value between 0 and 100.
* AWS [Delete Old EBS Snapshots](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Delete_Old_EBS_Snapshots.ipynb): Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) snapshots are created incrementally, an initial snapshot will include all the data on the disk, and subsequent snapshots will only store the blocks on the volume that have changed since the prior snapshot. Unchanged data is not stored, but referenced using the previous snapshot. This runbook helps us to find old EBS snapshots and thereby lower storage costs.
* AWS [Delete Unused AWS Log Streams](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Delete_Unused_AWS_Log_Streams.ipynb): Cloudwatch will retain empty Log Streams after the data retention time period. Those log streams should be deleted in order to save costs. This runbook can find unused log streams over a threshold number of days and help you delete them.
* AWS [Delete Unused AWS NAT Gateways](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Delete_Unused_AWS_NAT_Gateways.ipynb): This runbook can be used to identify and remove any unused NAT Gateways. This allows us to adhere to best practices and avoid unnecessary costs. NAT gateways are used to connect a private instance with outside networks. When a NAT gateway is provisioned, AWS charges you based on the number of hours it was available and the data (GB) it processes.
* AWS [Delete Unused AWS Secrets](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Delete_Unused_AWS_Route53_Healthchecks.ipynb): When we associate healthchecks with an endpoint, Amazon Route53 sends health check requests to the endpoint IP address. These health checks validate that the endpoint IP addresses are operating as intended. There may be multiple reasons that healtchecks are lying usused for example- health check was mistakenly configured against your application by another customer, health check was configured from your account for testing purposes but wasn't deleted when testing was complete, health check was based on domain names and hence requests were sent due to DNS caching,  Elastic Load Balancing service updated its public IP addresses due to scaling, and the IP addresses were reassigned to your load balancer, and many more. This runbook finds such healthchecks and deletes them to save AWS costs.
* AWS [Delete Unused AWS Secrets](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Delete_Unused_AWS_Secrets.ipynb): This runbook can be used to delete unused secrets in AWS.
* AWS [Lowering AWS CloudTrail Costs by Removing Redundant Trails](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Lowering_AWS_CloudTrail_Costs_by_Removing_Redundant_Trails.ipynb): The AWS CloudTrail service allows developers to enable policies managing compliance, governance, and auditing of their AWS account. In addition, AWS CloudTrail offers logging, monitoring, and storage of any activity around actions related to your AWS structures. The service activates from the moment you set up your AWS account and while it provides real-time activity visibility, it also means higher AWS costs. Here Finding Redundant Trails in AWS
* AWS [Release Unattached AWS Elastic IPs](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Release_Unattached_AWS_Elastic_IPs.ipynb): A disassociated Elastic IP address remains allocated to your account until you explicitly release it. AWS imposes a small hourly charge for Elastic IP addresses that are not associated with a running instance. This runbook can be used to deleted those unattached AWS Elastic IP addresses.
* AWS [Stop Untagged AWS EC2 Instances](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Stop_Untagged_EC2_Instances.ipynb): This runbook can be used to Stop all EC2 Instances that are Untagged
* AWS [Terminate EC2 Instances Without Valid Lifetime Tag](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Terminate_EC2_Instances_Without_Valid_Lifetime_Tag.ipynb): This runbook can be used to list all the EC2 instances which don't have a lifetime tag and then terminate them.
* AWS [AWS Redshift Get Daily Costs from AWS Products](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/aws_redshift_get_daily_product_costs.ipynb): This runbook can be used to create charts and alerts around Your AWS product usage. It requires a Cost and USage report to be live in RedShift.
* AWS [AWS Redshift Get Daily Costs from EC2 Usage](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/aws_redshift_get_ec2_daily_costs.ipynb): This runbook can be used to create charts and alerts around AWS EC2 usage. It requires a Cost and USage report to be live in RedShift.
* AWS [AWS Redshift Update Database](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/aws_redshift_update_database.ipynb): This runbook can be used to update a redshift database from a SQL file stored in S3.
