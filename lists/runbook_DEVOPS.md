 # Runbooks in DEVOPS
* AWS [Change AWS EBS Volume To GP3 Type](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Change_AWS_EBS_Volume_To_GP3_Type.ipynb): This runbook can be used to change the type of an EBS volume to GP3(General Purpose 3). GP3 type volume has a number of advantages over it's predecessors. gp3 volumes are ideal for a wide variety of applications that require high performance at low cost
* AWS [Change AWS Route53 TTL](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Change_AWS_Route53_TTL.ipynb): For a record in a hosted zone, lower TTL means that more queries arrive at the name servers because the cached values expire sooner. If you configure a higher TTL for your records, then the intermediate resolvers cache the records for longer time. As a result, there are fewer queries received by the name servers. This configuration reduces the charges corresponding to the DNS queries answered. However, higher TTL slows the propagation of record changes because the previous values are cached for longer periods. This Runbook can be used to configure a higher value of a TTL .
* AWS [Copy AMI to All Given AWS Regions](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Copy_ami_to_all_given_AWS_regions.ipynb): This runbook can be used to copy AMI from one region to multiple AWS regions using unSkript legos with AWS CLI commands.We can get all the available regions by using AWS CLI Commands.
* AWS [Create IAM User with policy](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Create_IAM_User_with_policy.ipynb): Create new IAM user with a security Policy.  Sends confirmation to Slack.
* AWS [Delete EBS Volume With Low Usage](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Delete_EBS_Volumes_With_Low_Usage.ipynb): c9e1563d58cd6e3778a6c3fb11643498e3cdf3965a18c09214423998d62847b8
* AWS [Delete Old EBS Snapshots](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Delete_Old_EBS_Snapshots.ipynb): Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) snapshots are created incrementally, an initial snapshot will include all the data on the disk, and subsequent snapshots will only store the blocks on the volume that have changed since the prior snapshot. Unchanged data is not stored, but referenced using the previous snapshot. This runbook helps us to find old EBS snapshots and thereby lower storage costs.
* AWS [Delete Unattached AWS EBS Volumes](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Delete_Unattached_EBS_Volume.ipynb): This runbook can be used to delete all unattached EBS Volumes within an AWS region. You can delete an Amazon EBS volume that you no longer need. After deletion, its data is gone and the volume can't be attached to any instance. So before deletion, you can store a snapshot of the volume, which you can use to re-create the volume later.
* AWS [Delete Unused AWS Log Streams](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Delete_Unused_AWS_Log_Streams.ipynb): Cloudwatch will retain empty Log Streams after the data retention time period.

* AWS [Delete Unused AWS NAT Gateways](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Delete_Unused_AWS_NAT_Gateways.ipynb): This runbook can be used to identify and remove any unused NAT Gateways. This allows us to adhere to best practices and avoid unnecessary costs. NAT gateways are used to connect a private instance with outside networks. When a NAT gateway is provisioned, AWS charges you based on the number of hours it was available and the data (GB) it processes.
* AWS [Delete Unused AWS Secrets](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Delete_Unused_AWS_Secrets.ipynb): This runbook can be used to delete unused secrets in AWS.
* AWS [Detach EC2 Instance from ASG](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Detach_Instance_from_ASG.ipynb): This runbook can be used to detach an instance from Auto Scaling Group. You can remove (detach) an instance that is in the Service state from an Auto Scaling group. After the instance is detached, you can manage it independently from the rest of the Auto Scaling group. By detaching an instance, you can move an instance out of one Auto Scaling group and attach it to a different group. For more information, see Attach EC2 instances to your Auto Scaling group.
* AWS [Detach EC2 Instance from ASG and Load balancer](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Detach_ec2_Instance_from_ASG.ipynb): This runbook can be used to detach an instance from Auto Scaling Group and Load Balancer. You can remove (detach) an instance that is in the InService state from an Auto Scaling group. After the instance is detached, you can manage it independently from the rest of the Auto Scaling group. By detaching an instance, you can move an instance out of one Auto Scaling group and attach it to a different group. For more information, see Attach EC2 instances to your Auto Scaling group.
* AWS [Detect ECS failed deployment](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Detect_ECS_failed_deployment.ipynb): This runbook check if there is a failed deployment in progress for a service in an ECS cluster.

Afterwards, it deletes the files backed up and send a message on a specified Slack channel. It uses SSH and linux commands to perform the functions it needs.
* AWS [Enforce HTTP Redirection across all AWS ALB instances](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Enforce_HTTP_Redirection_across_AWS_ALB.ipynb): This runbook can be used to enforce HTTP redirection across all AWS ALBs. Web encryption protocols like SSL and TLS have been around for nearly three decades. By securing web data in transit, these security measures ensure that third parties canâ€™t simply intercept unencrypted data and cause harm. HTTPS uses the underlying SSL/TLS technology and is the standard way to communicate web data in an encrypted and authenticated manner instead of using insecure HTTP protocol. In this runbook, we implement the industry best practice of redirecting all unencrypted HTTP data to the secure HTTPS protocol.
