    "\n",
    "## Mission\n",
    "To make CloudOps automation simpler for developers and DevOps engineers. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Vision \n",
    "A single repository to satisfy all your day-to-day CloudOps automation needs. Are you looking for a script to automate your Kubernetes management? \n",
    "Or do you need a script to restart the pod that is OOMkilled? We will cover that for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Runbooks\n",
    "\n",
    "DYNAMIC_CONTENT\n",
    "\n",
    "## Persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "> Inside the docker there is `/data` folder that is where we store the `credentials` and `runbooks`. So if you would like to retain the `connectors` and `runbooks` you can use the docker's `-v` option to retain the changes done on the `docker`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: New files are created inside the docker and will persist unless --rm option is used.\n",
    "> \n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating your own runbook\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to create your own ipynb file and start using it. Do the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "`On your Host machine`:\n",
    " 1. git clone https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation\n",
    " 2. cd Awesome-CloudOps-Automation\n",
    " 3. CONTAINER=`docker ps -l | grep awesome-runbooks | awk '{print $1}'`\n",
    " 4. docker cp templates/runbooks/StartHere.ipynb $CONTAINER:/home/jovyan/runbooks/<YOUR_RUNBOOK_NAME.ipynb>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now simply point your browser to `http:127.0.0.1:8888/lab/tree/<YOUER_RUNBOOK_NAME.ipynb>`. \n",
    "Volla! you are all set! Start searching your favorite actions, drag and drop them in the \n",
