  "name": "Enforce HTTP Redirection across all AWS ALB instances",
  "description": "This runbook can be used to enforce HTTP redirection across all AWS ALBs. Web encryption protocols like SSL and TLS have been around for nearly three decades. By securing web data in transit, these security measures ensure that third parties canâ€™t simply intercept unencrypted data and cause harm. HTTPS uses the underlying SSL/TLS technology and is the standard way to communicate web data in an encrypted and authenticated manner instead of using insecure HTTP protocol. In this runbook, we implement the industry best practice of redirecting all unencrypted HTTP data to the secure HTTPS protocol.",
