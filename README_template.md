# About the project

## Mission
To make CloudOps automation simpler for developers and DevOps engineers. 

## Vision 
A single repository to satisfy all your day-to-day CloudOps automation needs. Are you looking for a script to automate your Kubernetes management? Or do you need a script to restart the pod that is OOMkilled? We will cover that for you. 
                                                               
## Quick start

### Get started with docker
#### Linux/Mac/Windows (x86-64/arm64)

```
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 \
 -v $HOME/.unskript:/data \
 --user root \
 docker.io/unskript/awesome-runbooks:latest
```


> Inside the docker there is `/data` folder that is where we store the `credentials` and `runbooks`. So if you would like to retain the `connectors` and `runbooks` you can use the docker's `-v` option to retain the changes done on the `docker`.

> Note: New files are created inside the docker and will persist unless --rm option is used.
> 
### Open the Runbook
Once you run the above command, here's the table which will help you find the URL for runbook of your choice. 

| **Category**                                                                                               | **Runbooks**                                                                                                                                                                 | **URL**                                                                                                    |

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/unskript/awesome-cloudops-automation/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. Check out our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details. 

Here is the Link for the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/blob/master/.github/DEVELOPERGUIDE.md)

### How to contribute?

#### Pre-requisites:
1. You can use the docker environment (see instructions above) with your infrastructure credentials for validating your changes. We also have a sandbox where you can do testing : open a free account on [unSkript](https://us.app.unskript.io/profiles/6c38d3da1cde7b3c0623d138f525a5508a3260c8) to access the sandbox. 
2. Join our [Slack Community](https://communityinviter.com/apps/cloud-ops-community/awesome-cloud-automation) so you can present yourself and get support

#### Step by step process for Hacktoberfest
1. Find or propose an issue you want to work on. 
2. Prepare the issue before you start working on it. 
    - Make sure the description is clear. 
    - Tag yourself in Assignees section. 
3. If using Docker
  `On your Host machine`:
   1. git clone https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation
   2. cd Awesome-CloudOps-Automation
   3. CONTAINER=`docker ps -l | grep awesome-runbooks | awk '{print $1}'`
   4. docker cp templates/runbooks/GCP.ipynb $CONTAINER:/home/jovyan/runbooks/<YOUR_RUNBOOK_NAME.ipynb>

  - Point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab/tree/<YOUR_RUNBOOK_NAME.ipynb>`
4. If using unSkript sandbox
    - Onboarding will drop you into runbook creation with sandbox credentials
    - Start building your lego from the proposed handle (GCP, k8s et al)
5. Create a branch
6. Copy over the template directory 
```
cp -r templates/legos your_connector/legos/your_lego_name e.g. cp -r templates/legos GCP/legos/gcp_filter_instance_by_label
```
7. You need to populate 4 files
    - lego.json : add the description, headline and function_name
    - lego.py : copy over the code you wrote inside the Jupyter interface into this file
    - README.md : some description about what the lego does
    - 1.png : a screenshot of the output of your code
7. Open a Pull Request and add a member of the core team as Reviewer (Jayasimha, Shloka, Amit, Abhishek)
9. Expect a feedback and merge in the next 48h-72h
10. Once merged, promote your work on LinkedIn, Twitter and other social media channels! (Optional, but people need to know you are awesome ðŸ˜‰)
